I am Wayne Wages, a Business Intelligence Analyst with a certification form TripleTen. Proficient with Tableau and Excel. Understanding of SQL.</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='file:///C:/Users/mdpic/Downloads/Wayne%20M%20Wages%20Resume.pdf ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>

Currently I am working with customer data, focused around retention of employees as well as the scores of new applicants in our software. My previous experience has allowed me to find my love for data and making data driven decisions. 
I started TripleTen in the middle of 2023 to get a deeper more technical understanding on how to work with data and present it further to other business leaders/users.

Some Facts about me:
I enjoy playing coed beach volleyball with my wife in tournaments across the lower 48.
I love carpentry and building.
At the moment, I am currently renovating my first house.
I love to cook and love re-creating hibachi in my backyard.
My goal for 2023 is to break into the Business INtellogence/Data Field.
